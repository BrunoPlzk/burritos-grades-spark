Please upload ‘Burrito.csv’, ‘Burrito_cleaned.csv’ and ‘df_withall.csv’.

‘Burrito_cleaned.csv’ is usefull once in the Modeling part, it is the dataframe just before this part, however due to spark operations, manipulations on df can take quite a long time, so we can re-upload this dataframe.

‘df_withall.csv’, dataframe used to do the best burrito prediction.
